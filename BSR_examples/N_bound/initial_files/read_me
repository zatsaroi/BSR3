#  folder N_bound contains the results of calculations, whereas
#  subfolder "initial_files" contains the data that 
#  you should prepare to begin the calculations

#  we are working in the frozen-core approximation and represent
#  the N atomic states through expansion other  N+ ionic states

#  the model includes 9 N+ states: 

   2p2_3P
   2p2_1D
   2p2_1S
   2s_2p3_5S  
   2s_2p3_3D  
   2s_2p3_3P  
   2s_2p3_1D  
   2s_2p3_3S  
   2s_2p3_1P  

#  these states are supposed to be obtained in some MCHF calculations
#  and represented as pair of name.c and name.w files

#  we also supposed that the N-states with equivalent electrons 
#  may be not enough accurately described in the frozen-core approximation 
#  and we prepared them in separate MCHF calculations

   2p3_4S   
   2p3_2D   
   2p3_2P   
   2s_2p4_4P
   2s_2p4_2D
   2s_2p4_2P
   2s_2p4_2S

#  These states will be included in frosen-core (CC) expansions as
#  perturber states with saving their expansions coefficients

#--------------------------------------------------------------     step 1
#  preparation of ionic states orbitals in BSR-format:

#  we need choose B-spline grid and create knot.dat file;
#  usually, we just copy knot.dat from some other calculations
#  and change a few parameters if needed

#  prepare bsw-files from w-files using the utility "w_bsw"

w_bsw 2p2_1D.w
w_bsw 2p2_1S.w
w_bsw 2p2_3P.w
w_bsw 2p3_2D.w
w_bsw 2p3_2P.w
w_bsw 2p3_4S.w
w_bsw 2s_2p3_1D.w
w_bsw 2s_2p3_1P.w
w_bsw 2s_2p3_3D.w
w_bsw 2s_2p3_3P.w
w_bsw 2s_2p3_3S.w        
w_bsw 2s_2p3_5S.w
w_bsw 2s_2p4_2D.w
w_bsw 2s_2p4_2P.w
w_bsw 2s_2p4_2S.w
w_bsw 2s_2p4_4P.w

#  it is a quick procedure; at this stage you may play with
#  B-spline parameters in knot.dat to choose most appropriate grid
#  (see also the description of B-spline grid in the BSR libraries documentation) 

#  check the end of w_bsw.log file to see the accuracy 
#  of the B-spline representation

#  all other calculations should used the same knot.dat file
#  without changes !!!

#--------------------------------------------------------------     step 2

#  prepare 'target' file which contain list of ionic states
#  and desirade total terms for N states 
#  (see target.0 as example of inital target file, this file 
#   will be furher modified by programs bsr_prep and bsr_conf) 

#  prepare bsr_par file with specific paramters 
#  this file can be empty if only default parametrs are used

#  run the first preparation programs:

bsr_prep3
bsr_conf3 

#  at this stage you may chack the size of resultiong expansions
#  and other details in file target and log-files

#--------------------------------------------------------------     step 3
#  bound-state B-spline calculations for given terms:

bsr_breit3 klsp1=1 klsp2=14 
bsr_mat3 klsp1=1 klsp2=14
bsr_hd3 klsp1=1 klsp2=14  itype=-1  msol=10

bound_tab

#  "bound_tab" file will contain the list of bound states obtained;
#   you change the parameters in the end of file to change the output,
#   i.e, binding or excitation energies, specific partial waves, etc.


#----------------------------------------------------------------   step 4
#  extract specific states for following calculations 
#  for e-Ca problem:

   To do that, we need prepare bound_bsw.inp file, which contains
   index of solution, index of partial wave, name of the states.
   (one line for each state)

   It is the similar information as in the bound_tab file, so practically
   we just need to copy the corresponding lines from the bound_tab file.
   Here we need to check the names given for the solutions by the bsr_hd
   program - they can be wrong or confusing. 
   If you using the bound_bsw.inp file with name, when you just run
   
bound_bsw  

   The output will contain the pairs  name.c and name.bsw for each chosen state.

   If there are too many states and checking the name is difficult,
   there is option to run with some generic names:

bound_bsw  mode=sol

   In this case, the output for each state will contain files:
       sol_nnn_mmmm.c  and  sol_nnn_mmmm.bsw
   where nnn - partial wave index, mmmm - index of solution for given term

#----------------------------------------------------------------  step 5
#  calculation of oscilator strengths:

#  consider as exmaple the oscillation strenths from the ground state, 4s2 1S,
#  to the excited 1Po states. 
#  Acording the target file, 1S states are in 1st partial wave, 1Po states are
#  in 3rd partial wave

mult3  cfg.001 cfg.003 E1
bsr_dmat3  cfg.001 cfg.003 b b  istate1=1  mstate2=10

#  results are in file "zf_res"
