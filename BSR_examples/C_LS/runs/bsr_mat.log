BSR_MAT parameters:

klsp1   =   1 - fist partial wave under consideration
klsp2   =  12 - last partial wave under consideration

iitar   =   0 - target states are supposed to be orthogonal
                eigenfunctions of target Hamiltonian

mk      =   7 - maximum multipole index 

eps_c   =   0.10D-09  -  tolerance for integral coefficients
eps_det =   0.10D-09  -  tolerance for total overlap factors
eps_ovl =   0.10D-07  -  tolerance for one-elecytron overlaps

s_ovl   =   0.75D+00  -  channel overlap limit for additional orthogonality conditions
s_pert  =   0.50D+00  -  perturber overlap limit for additional orthogonality conditions

mrel    =   0 - relativistic corrections is not included

nb      =   2000 - number of blocks in module cmdata
kb      =    100 - max. number of blocks for given type of integrals
